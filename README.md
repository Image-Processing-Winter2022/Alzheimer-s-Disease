<br/>
<br/>We used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images">Kaggle Alzheimer's Dataset</a> and the code was Implemented using KERAS. 
<br/>
<br/>We Trained the network using the Google Colab.
<br/>
### How to use these files:
<br/>Please download the kaggle.json and Alzheimer's.ipynb files and put them in your google drive. After that, you can easily run the project using the file Alzheimer's.ipynb.
<br/>
<br/>It is worth mentioning that the file kaggle.json is the Kaggle API Token, and everyone also can download this file from her/his own Kaggle account on the Kaggle website. Using this API, you can interact with Competitions and Datasets to directly download the dataset from the Kaggle website, So there is no need for you to download the dataset.
<br/>
<br/>The file Alzheimer's.ipynb has comments for each section and consists of 13 Steps from connecting to google drive and also downloading the dataset to plotting the results.
<br/>
<br/>The file IM_report.pdf contains all the details of the project, followed by the results of the experiments performed in this research. 

Please feel free to contact us, if you need any further information about these files or Dataset.
